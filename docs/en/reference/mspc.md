The Zhuhai Marine Science Popularization Center (hereinafter referred to as the "Center") is located in the Haiqin Building No. 4 on the Zhuhai Campus of Sun Yat-sen University, which also houses the Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai). With a display area of 3,707 square meters, the Center leverages the Laboratory's significant infrastructure and scientific research achievements, combined with the high-quality educational resources of Sun Yat-sen University, to jointly establish a key hub for marine science popularization in the Greater Bay Area.

The Center integrates "popular science, science education, and scientific research," fully highlighting the distinctive characteristics of marine disciplines, the regional features of Zhuhai, and the hallmarks of technological innovation. Structured around marine science knowledge and beginning from the perspective of "marine observation," the Center narrates the story of the "Voyage of Ocean Discovery," divided into four main chapters. The exhibition content covers topics such as the origins of marine science, new technologies in marine observation, the composition and movement of seawater, fascinating seabed topography and ecosystems, and Zhuhai's distinctive marine features. A key highlight is the inclusion of the Southern Marine Laboratory's scientific achievement—the world's first intelligent unmanned research mother ship, "Zhu Hai Yun"—as an interactive exhibit, allowing visitors to gain a training-level experience of piloting a research vessel.

Dedicated to providing diverse and comprehensive marine science popularization education experiences, the Center combines with the Laboratory's existing exhibition spaces, various advanced public experimental platforms, and multifunctional lecture halls to form a coordinated science education system that integrates standardization, professionalism, and distinctive features. This system aims to fulfill two primary functions: routine marine science popularization education and specialized popular science study programs.

As a crucial component of the Southern Marine Laboratory's marine science popularization education base, the Center operates under the service philosophy of "Joining Hands to Realize the Ocean Dream" and holds the important mission of "Promoting the Scientific Spirit and Igniting Scientific Dreams." It is committed to enhancing public awareness and capability in "Understanding the Ocean, Caring for the Ocean, and Mastering the Ocean," aspiring to become a new benchmark for science education in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area that inspires innovative thinking, cultivates scientific literacy, and promotes marine culture.
